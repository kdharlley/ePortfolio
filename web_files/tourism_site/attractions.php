            <!-- Text Source: http://www.hipafrica.com/topspot/aqua-safari-resort/ -->
            <p> Aqua Safari is the answer to an immense demand for high-end accommodation and hang out spots in the coastal area of Ada in the Greater Accra Region, 1 hour outside the city center.The hotel is set on the Volta River, before it gives out to the ocean, and the finest feature of the hotel is the common restaurant and bar area, with its long wooden deck, that leads to a jetty perched on the river.The hotel’s least fine feature happens to be the rooms, which consists of 71 standard and deluxe rooms, and chalets.</p>
