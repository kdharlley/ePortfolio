## Client Description

<!-- [Tell us about your client. Who is your client? What kind of website do they want? What are their key goals?]

[NOTE: If you are redesigning an existing website, give us the current URL and some screenshots of the current site. Tell us how you plan to update the site in a significant way that meets the final project requirements.] -->

"The Language Expansion Program (LEP) is a student-led program that fosters language learning in a comfortable and encouraging environment for its participants. LEP provides a unique opportunity for individuals in the Cornell community to pursue their interest in language study and to improve their speaking abilities."

Most of us are interested in improving certain language-speaking abilities ourselves, so we thought that working with LEP could help give them the digital publicity they need!

Website goals: "Give information about the org, contact info, get people to come to our events, and be able to join/leave our listserv or notify us that someone wants to join or something to that extent, and maybe a feedback page or something too cause weâ€™re still improving stuff within the org."

Current LEP website: http://orgsync.rso.cornell.edu/org/lep

Since Cornell is phasing out OrgSync, LEP is in need of an independent website for its current and prospective members. We plan to implement a login for the executive board to easily modify information on the website without relying on a third party like OrgSync.

Screenshots of current OrgSync website:

## Meeting Notes

<!-- [By this point, you have met once with your client to discuss all their requirements. Include your notes from the meeting, an email they sent you, or whatever you used to keep track of what was discussed at the meeting. Include these artifacts here.] -->

Notes from client: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1scmZkm8e1J6MTm3WifFjSxH8tpQ9c0NFpBVZblxEllg/edit?usp=sharing

## Purpose & Content

<!-- [Tell us the purpose of the website and what it is all about.] -->

* Give general information about LEP
* Provide LEP contact information & member information for target audience
* Inform target audience of LEP events (and encourage them to attend them)
* Allow target audience to indicate interest in joining listserv
* Allow login for LEP executive board to directly modify parts of the website

## Target Audience(s)

<!-- [Tell us about the potential audience for this website. How, when, and where would they interact with the website? Get as much detail as possible from the client to help you find representative users.] -->

Cornell community (and greater Ithaca community, to a lesser extent) interested in improving proficiency in a foreign language
* Would interact with website to learn more about the organization and its events
* Would also interact with website to indicate interest in joining listserv or executive board

## Client Requirements & Target Audiences' Needs

<!-- [Collect your client's needs and wants for the website. Come up with several appropriate design ideas on how those needs may be met. In the **Rationale** field, justify your ideas and add any additional comments you have. There is no specific number of needs required for this, but you need enough to do the job.]

Example:
- (_pick one:_) Client Requirement/Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need** [What does your client and audience need or want?]
    - Client wants to cater to people who speak different languages.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices** [How will you meet those needs or wants?]
    - Create web-pages manually in multiple languages.
  - **Rationale** [Justify your decisions; additional notes.]
    - Create multiple pages in multiple languages manually. -->

- Client Requirement
  - **Requirement or Need**
    - Client wants to be able to edit parts of the website without going into the code or using a third party
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - Add access controls to edit the site content
    - Show forms & buttons upon login to edit certain parts of the website (e.g. add upcoming events, modify E-Board members shown)
  - **Rationale**
    - Access controls will allow only E-Board members to edit the content of the site
    - Forms & buttons allow for straightforward website editing

- Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need**
    - Audience wants a way to indicate interest in the organization
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - Create interest form for providing contact information/general information
  - **Rationale**
    - Interest form provides a standardized way to indicate interest

- Target Audience Need
  - **Requirement or Need**
    - A certain part of the audience (members of the club) is interested in applying for executive board positions. They need information for the positions available and a way to apply for a position.
  - **Design Ideas and Choices**
    - Create form to apply for eboard position & information about each position
  - **Rationale**
    - Interest form provides a standardized way to indicate interest in applying to become an eboard member and the information about each position gives context to further help the audience know how to apply.


## Initial Design

  Home page: provides basic information about the organization
  ![Home page](sketch1_1.jpg)

  Image gallery (meet the eboard): gives information about executive board and allows this page to be modified upon login
  ![Image gallery](sketch1_2.jpg)

  Image gallery (single image view): shows larger picture & more detailed information for each executive board member
  ![Image gallery (single image view)](sketch1_3.jpg)

  Join Us page: various forms to indicate interest in the organization
  ![Join Us page](sketch1_4.jpg)

  Contact Us page: provides contact information for the organization
  ![Contact Us page](sketch1_5.jpg)

  Login page: incorporates access controls into website
  ![Login page](sketch1_6.jpg)

  Add event upon login: allows event page to be modified upon login
  ![Add event upon login](sketch1_7.jpg)


## Information Architecture, Content, and Navigation

<!-- [Lay out the plan for how you'll organize the site and which content will go where. Note any content (e.g., text, image) that you need to make/get from the client.]

[Document your process, we want to see how you came up with your content organization and website navigation.]

[Note: There is no specific amount to write here. You simply need enough content to do the job.] -->

- **Preliminary Navigation Plan**
  - Home
    - About Us
  - Meet the E-Board
    - Image gallery - of each eboard member with information about member
    - Page content can be modified via form
  - Events
    - list of events
    - Page content can be modified via form
  - Join Us
    - Interest Form
    - E-Board application Form
  - Log In/Log Out

- **Content**
  - *Home*: General information about their club and who they are
  - *Meet the Board*: A picture of each EBoard member w/ basic information about them (name, netId, role, bio). If you click to view more details, it opens up to another page with more information about them. If you are logged in to edit the site (via Log In/Log Out page), the photo and information of each EBoard can be editted and an EBoard member can be added or deleted.
  - *Events*: A list of all the events. If logged in to edit (via Log In/Log Out page), you can add and edit events
  - *Join* - a join form and apply to be an eboard member form. If logged in to edit (via Log In/Log Out page) you can access the database of inserted entries.

- **Process**

  All important components of website
  ![card sort](card_sort.jpg)

  Home page group
  ![card sort](page1.jpg)

  "Meet the E-Board" group
  ![card sort](page2.jpg)

  "Join Us" group
  ![card sort](page3.jpg)

  "Events" group
  ![card sort](page4.jpg)

  "Log in" group
  ![card sort](page5.jpg)

  "Contact Us" group
  ![card sort](page6.jpg)

  - Most of the content was already outlined in their previous website, so we adapted most of that information accordingly
  - The client said that they wanted to website to be able to be edited by someone who didn't need to know web development and code, so we added a log in feature to allow the website to be altered.
  - Some content was excluded (such as the calendar view) because it didn't provide sufficient information for events--instead, we will implement a list view for each event
  - Contact Us page was removed because it was just links to their social media (which will be on the footer)

## Interactivity

<!-- [What interactive features will your site have? What PHP elements will you include?]

[Also, describe how the interactivity connects with the needs of the clients/target audience.] -->

Our site will have an edit mode where eboard members will be able to edit their names, bios, and images on the "E-Board" page. This edit mode will be entered upon login. The "E-Board" page will act as an image gallery with a search bar and options to order members by name, title, etc.

Eboard members will also be able to add events to a database which will be programatically included on the "Events" page. Apart from this, admins will be able to add, edit, and delete events.

Moreover, which member is in charge of which event will be able to be indicated which can be added and removed.

The target audience will be able to collapse or expand information about specific events (implemented with JavaScript) depending on their specific interests since each individual may be interested in a different language or event. This also makes the website more visually concise

Additionally, forms to indicate interest and apply to the E-Board will further increase the interactivity of the site for the target audience to express interest in the organization.

By including edit, delete, and add functions for many components of this site, the client's desire for the website to be editable by individuals not adept in web development will be achieved. Our client expressed the desire for the website to be editable by individuals with little to no web development experience, and these inclusions will satisfy the aforementioned need.

## Work Distribution

<!-- [Describe how each of your responsibilities will be distributed among your group members.]

[Set internal deadlines. Determine your internal dependencies. Whose task needs to be completed first in order for another person's task to be relevant? Be specific in your task descriptions so that everyone knows what needs to be done and can track the progress effectively. Consider how much time will be needed to review and integrate each other's work. Most of all, make sure that tasks are balanced across the team.] -->

**Responsibilities**

(Although we will delegate loose roles, they are not exclusive!)

- main form of communication with client - Billie
- index.php - Ashley
- general css design - Ashley, Billie, Hahnbee
- login - Ashley
- events page - Billie, Hahnbee, Kenneth
- 'Join Us' form - Genavieve
  - access controls
  - if user is website editor -> access form replies & ability to edit form
- EBoard members image gallery - Kenneth and Hahnbee
  - includes access controls
- JavaScript components - Hahnbee

<!-- ## Additional Comments

[If you feel like you haven't fully explained your design choices, or if you want to explain some other functions in your site (such as special design decisions that might not meet the final project requirements), you can use this space to justify your design choices or ask other questions about the project and process.]

--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 1; vvv Milestone 2 -->

## Client Feedback

<!-- [Share the feedback notes you received from your client about your initial design.] -->
Client comments: "The modifying pages stuff doesnâ€™t have to be too elaborate because org details can change. Just need to be able to add events and upload photos/bios when needed."

We didn't previously have a field for uploading images (or uploading other information), so we were sure to incorporate that into our iterated design below.

## Iterated Design

<!-- [Improve your design based on the feedback you received from your client.] -->

 Newly revised version for E-Board file uploading:

 Option to browse & upload a photo for new E-Board members
 ![Eboard](sketch2_1.jpg)

 Also added more visible options to delete components of E-Board and Event pages:

 Updated image gallery page with option to delete a profile
 ![Delete Profile](sketch2_2.jpg)

 Option to delete an event if needed
 ![Delete Event](sketch2_3.jpg)

## Evaluate your Design

<!-- [Use the GenderMag method to evaluate your wireframes.]

[Pick a persona that you believe will help you address the gender bias within your design.] -->

I've selected **Abby** as my persona.

I've selected Abby as my persona because the audience of our website is open to the greater Ithaca community which may be less inclined to acquaintence themselves with unfamiliar computing tasks. Abby is also risk averse and prone to blame herself for problems she runs into which is different from us, the website creators. So, by using Abby as our persona, accumatively our and her perspective will allow us to consider a wider perspectives and make our website more inclusive.

### Tasks

<!-- [You will need to evaluate at least 2 tasks (known as scenarios in the GenderMag literature). List your tasks here. These tasks are the same as the task you learned in INFO/CS 1300.]
[For each task, list the ideal set of actions that you would like your users to take when working towards the task.] -->

**Task 1:** Sign up to become an ESP member

Required actions for Task 1:

  1. Navigate to "Join Us" page
  2. Complete interest form
  3. Submit interest form

**Task 2:** Abby has recently become an executive board member and would like to upload her information onto the "Meet the Board" page so LEP members can get to know her better

Required actions for Task 2:

  1. Log in
  2. Navigate to "Events" page
  3. Fill in form and upload picture
  4. Submit form

### Cognitive Walkthrough

<!-- [Perform a cognitive walkthrough using the GenderMag method for all of your Tasks. Use the GenderMag template in the <documents/gendermag-template.md> file.] -->

#### Task 1 - Cognitive Walkthrough

**Task 1: Sign up to become an ESP member**

**Subgoal #1 : Sign up to become an LEP member**

  - Will [Abby] have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Motivations/Strategies.)

    Abby uses technologies to accomplish her tasks. Her end goal is to become a club member, so since she is motivated to accomplish this task, she will recognize that this is a necessary step to reach her end goal.

**Action #1A : Press on 'Join Us' link**

  - Will [Abby] know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)
      Abby performs tasks using familiar and predictable features, and links are a familiar and predictable way to navigate through a website.

  - If [Abby] does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
    Yes, because the link will direct Abby to the "Join Us" page and she will realize she made progress.

  **Subgoal #2 : Fill in form**

  - Will [Abby] have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Motivations/Strategies.)
    Her end goal is to become a club member, so since she is motivated to accomplish this task, she will recognize (by scanning the page) that filling in a form is a necessary step to reach this goal.

**Action #2A : Fill out every blank in the form**
  - Will [Abby] know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Knowledge/Skills, Motivations/Strategies, Self-Efficacy and Tinkering.)

    - Yes, maybe or no: [maybe]
    - Why? (Especially consider [Abby]'s Self-Efficacy and Attitude toward Risk.)
    Once the submit button is pressed it should indicate a 'Thank you for applying to become a member' to indicate that her form was sent, but this isn't currently specified. With a visible message, Abby will definitely know she reached her goal.

#### Task 2 - Cognitive Walkthrough

**Task 2: Abby has recently become an executive board member and would like to add her information onto the "Meet the Board" page so ESP members can get to know her better**

**Subgoal # 1: Login**

  - Will Abby have formed this sub-goal as a step to their overall goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [maybe]
    - Why?
        Abby may not know she has to log in to access the Eboard member features, especially if she is less inclined toward tinkering with the website to find out.

**Action # 1A: Click Login link**

  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [yes]
    - Why?

**Action # 3A : Enter information into form and upload photo**

  - Will Abby know what to do at this step?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [maybe]
    - Why?
        Not all fields may be applicable/understandable to her (e.g. "Year" for non-students). Since Abby is less inclined toward tinkering, it might be difficult for her to glean information about the requirements of the form.

  - If Abby does the right thing, will she know that she did the right thing, and is making progress towards her goal?
    - Yes, maybe or no: [no]
    - Why?

    - Yes, maybe or no: [no]
    - Why?
        No clear indication that the form was successfully submitted and no way to check. With a visible message, Abby will definitely know she reached her goal since she has a comprehensive information processing style.

### Cognitive Walk-though Results

<!-- [Did you discover any issues with your design? What were they? How will you change your design to address the gender-inclusiveness bugs you discovered?]

[Your responses here should be **very** thorough and thoughtful.] -->

We discovered that when a form is submitted, it should indicate that it was successfully completed so that the user can know that they are making progress towards their goal. This is especially helpful for people with comprehensive information processing styles.

Additionally, forms should indicate which elements of the form are required, and making the forms sticky might be helpful as well. This especially accommodates for people like Abby with process-oriented learning styles who may not want to tinker with a form to learn how it functions.

## Final Design

<!-- [Include sketches of your finalized design.]
[What changes did you make to your final design based on the results on your cognitive walkthrough?] -->

Final design - Iteration 1

(Includes file uploads per client feedback + verification that a form was successfully submitted per cognitive walkthrough)

Home page
![final](sketch1_1.jpg)

E-Board image gallery - add a profile
![final](sketch2_1.jpg)

E-Board image gallery - delete a profile

E-Board image gallery - single member view
![final](sketch1_3.jpg)

Contact Us page
![final](sketch1_5.jpg)

Login page
![final](sketch1_6.jpg)

Join Us page with interest forms
![final](sketch2_4.jpg)


Final design - Iteration 2

As we worked on our website and inputted data and other elements, we realized that there was too much content to fit onto the pages we had designed in the first iteration of the final design. Therefore, we split up some data onto new pages such as ebapps, listservapps, delete_positions, and eventEdit. In addition, we added a footer to display important contact information and cite external resources.

## Issues & Challenges

<!-- [Tell us about any issues or challenges you faced while trying to complete milestone 3. Bullet points preferred.] -->
* refreshing our memory on basic JavaScript for interactive elements
* working as a team and making sure that multiple people don't accidentally work on the same thing
* having to go through the process of reading and understanding someone else's code
* solving merge conflicts (Git log was confusing at times)
* having a comprehensive look on all pages and carefully checking for smaller details

--- <!-- ^^^ Milestone 3; vvv FINAL SUBMISSION-->

## Final Notes to the Client

<!-- [Include any other information that your client needs to know about your final website design. For example, what client wants or needs were unable to be realized in your final product? Why were you unable to meet those wants/needs?] -->
* This wasn't imperative, but including a search or filter option on the Events page--especially for different languages--would have been nice (we prioritized search for E-Board members instead due to time constraints)
* No option for logged-in users to create an entire form or edit a form since it was outside the scope of this class
* No sign-up option to create new accounts (we implemented a shared log-in instead) since it was outside the scope of this class
* The design doesn't currently scale well for mobile (or smaller screens in general) since that was outside the scope of this class
* More cohesive fonts could have been used to bring the design together (but were not thoroughly researched due to time constraints)

## Final Notes to the Graders

<!-- [1. Give us three specific strengths of your site that sets it apart from the previous website of the client (if applicable) and/or from other websites. Think of this as your chance to argue for the things you did really well.] -->

Strengths:

    1. Applicants may upload their resumes directly onto the website rather than emailing it to the club as done before. This will make it easier for students to apply and to keep E-Board applications organized.

    2. Site may be modified directly without using a third party like OrgSync (which Cornell is phasing out). This allows LEP to keep their website up-to-date and provide the most relevant information for their target audience.

    3. LEP aims to foster language learning in a comfortable and encouraging environment, so we intentionally designed our website to look more friendly and inviting than the original OrgSync one (which was relatively bare and impersonal)

<!-- [2. Tell us about things that don't work, what you wanted to implement, or what you would do if you keep working with the client in the future. Give justifications.] -->

Areas of improvement:

    1. Including a search or filter option on the Events page, especially for different languages, would have been useful for a language-learning organization. However, we instead prioritized search for E-Board members due to time constraints

    2. No option for logged-in users to create an entire form or edit a form since it was outside the scope of this class

    3. No sign-up option to create new accounts (we implemented a shared log-in instead) since it was outside the scope of this class

<!-- [3. Tell us anything else you need us to know for when we're looking at the project.] -->

Other notes:

Be sure to try out every button and link since many lead to forms or new pages!
